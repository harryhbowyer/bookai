This project is for writing a book.

The structure is as follows:
* Lore - any extra information about characters, locations, or the world
* Plan - the main content of the book, as plot and events, tied together into chapters.
* Rules - rules for ai to follow when performing tasks

The process for putting together the book is as follows:
1) create background lore
2) create main characters
3) create the main plot points
4) create interesting events in between plot points, and creating additional characters as needed
5) organize the events and plots into logical time-ordered chapters
