When writing stories, remember to include the 5 W's (who,where,when,why,what) and the 5 senses.
Consider each character's viewpoint and how they would react to a scene or event.
Include enough detail to make it interesting, but not too much detail which can make it a slog to go through.
Add humor where possible, but keep it tasteful, and in character.
