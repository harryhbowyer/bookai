The character files should contain the following information: race/species, background, personality, role in the story, physical description, and any additional information relevant to the world of genre.

Example for a magical fantasy:
## Elara Voss

- **Race/Species:** Half-elf (mother human, father elf)
- **Background and Personality:** Elara grew up in the shadowed outskirts of Eldoria's ancient forests (where: the Whispering Woods, when: during the waning moons of her 25th year, who: orphaned after a monster raid claimed her parents, why: seeking to reclaim her family's lost heirloom to prove her worth, what: she trained as a rogue archer). She's fiercely independent with a sharp wit, but her flaw is a deep-seated distrust of authority, stemming from village elders who shunned her mixed heritage. Motivated by a desire for belonging, she uses humor to deflect pain—like quipping about her "pointy-eared luck" during tense moments—making her engaging yet vulnerable.
- **Role in the Story:** Protagonist/hero, leading the quest against encroaching darkness.
- **Physical Description:** Slender and agile, with sun-kissed skin that smells faintly of pine sap from her woodland travels; her emerald eyes gleam like forest dew, and her auburn hair is braided with feathers that rustle softly in the wind.
- **Interaction with Magic or Monsters:** Elara wields subtle nature magic inherited from her elven side, enchanting arrows to track monsters through scent and sound; she views monsters not as mindless beasts but as corrupted kin, often attempting to commune with them before striking, adding a layer of moral complexity to her fights.
