This project is to be used with gen AI, using tools like an ide+extension (vscode+roocode or kilocode as an example), or a cli (like kilocode cli, amazon q, etc).
It should automatically pick up the Main.md file, which will refer to the other files.
Just tell it to the steps found in Main.md one by one, and modifying files manually as you go; create main characters, manually edit them, have it review or suggest changes, prompt you a choice of 3 characters to add, etc etc.
