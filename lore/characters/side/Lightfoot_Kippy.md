# Kippy Lightfoot (Side Character)

### Race/Species
Halfling (from the burrow-villages skirting the Ironspine Mountains, burly farmer stock with no taller kin).

### Class/Specialty/Job
Scout/Forager – sneaks through underbrush for supplies and intel, using slings and traps for small-scale defense.

### Background and Personality
Burrowed in a mountain foothill in his 29th year, when goblin-corrupted raids torched his fields, Kippy escaped via root tunnels, now foraging to reclaim a halfling seed pouch—heirloom of bountiful harvests—for his scattered folk. Plucky and irreverent, he quips "Big monsters, small problems—aim for the knees!" to boost morale. His flaw is cowardice masked as caution, abandoning posts in panics. Motivated by homecoming, his antics lighten dire treks.

### Role in the Story
Minor figure and comic ally to Thorne; gathers rations and maps for the group's Deepholm ventures, stumbling into Mirael's traps for humorous detonations that aid escapes, while his evasion skills foil Krug's patrols in minor chases.

### Physical Description
Compact and spry, with ruddy cheeks and curly brown hair tied in a ponytail. Bright blue eyes twinkle mischievously, and his fuzzy feet are callused from barefoot runs. He smells of fresh soil and pipeweed, his pockets bulging with nuts and stones.

### Additional Relevant Information
No magic, just agile traps like pitfall vines; treats monsters as "oversized pests" to snare, joking "Caught like a rat in my pantry—dinner's served!" after violent captures, adding levity to the gore with his pint-sized bravado.
