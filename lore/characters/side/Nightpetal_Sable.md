# Sable Nightpetal (Side Character)

### Race/Species
Elf (from the nocturnal groves of the Whispering Woods, night-bloom lineage pure and reclusive).

### Class/Specialty/Job
Spy/Whisperer – infiltrates shadows for secrets, using stealth and eavesdropping for alliances.

### Background and Personality
Bloomed under moonless skies in her 132nd year, as corruption silenced grove songs, Sable was orphaned by silent assassins, now whispering for a petal-orb heirloom to restore voices. Elusive and mockingly poetic, she hisses "Secrets bloom in dark—pluck at your peril." Her flaw is trust issues, vanishing mid-mission. Motivated by silenced justice, her intrigue weaves plots.

### Role in the Story
Minor figure manipulated by Vesper but allying with Sylara; feeds partial intel on antagonist plans, her betrayals leading to ambushes resolved in violent confrontations, adding layers to the darkness's web.

### Physical Description
Sleek and shadowy, with midnight skin blending into dusk. Raven hair veils pointed ears, and obsidian eyes reflect stars. She exudes night jasmine and mist, her silent steps leaving no trace.

### Additional Relevant Information
Subtle shadow affinity for blending, not full magic; views monsters as "echoes without song," attempting to quiet them before strikes, whispering "Hush now, the night's listening" in gory silences, her humor a veiled thorn.
