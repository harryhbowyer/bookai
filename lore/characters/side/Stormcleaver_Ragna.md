# Ragna Stormcleaver (Side Character)

### Race/Species
Human (from the stormy coasts near Eldoria, of fisher clans hardened by sea monsters twisted by the darkness).

### Class/Specialty/Job
Guard Captain/Enforcer – leads Eldoria's watch patrols, wielding a harpoon-spear for crowd control and beast hunts.

### Background and Personality
Forged in Eldoria's salty docks in her 31st year, amid a tidal surge of corrupted sea beasts, Ragna rose from fisher to captain after spearing the raid's alpha, now seeking a clan harpoon—heirloom etched with storm runes—to honor her drowned kin. Stern yet folksy, she barks orders with gallows humor like "Fight like the tide's turning—or get swept under!" Her flaw is rigid adherence to law, clashing with the group's rogue tactics and causing internal scuffles. Motivated by protecting her city, she grounds the protagonists' chaos.

### Role in the Story
Supporting ally and foil to Garrick; coordinates defenses against Krug's border raids, allying with the band for joint operations in the Whispering Woods' edges while her by-the-book style creates tension, occasionally manipulated by Mirael's false reports leading to violent misunderstandings.

### Physical Description
Tall and muscled from hauling nets, with weathered olive skin scarred by hook marks. Cropped black hair whips like waves, and her steel-gray eyes pierce like gulls. She smells of brine, tar, and sweat, her callused grip firm on her weapon's haft.

### Additional Relevant Information
Purely martial, no magic, using tactical formations against monsters viewed as "storm-tossed wrecks" to be reeled in; her humor emerges post-battle, toasting "To the deep—and the fools who feed it" over ale, tempering the violence with resilient camaraderie.
