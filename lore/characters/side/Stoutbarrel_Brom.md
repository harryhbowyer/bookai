# Brom Stoutbarrel (Side Character)

### Race/Species
Dwarf (from the ale-soaked taverns of Deepholm's mid-levels, of a brewer clan with no surface admixtures).

### Class/Specialty/Job
Tavern Keeper/Bartender – runs a rowdy inn in Eldoria, serving info alongside drinks and brewing potent ales that double as improvised weapons.

### Background and Personality
Born in Deepholm's humid breweries in his 65th year, amid a festival turned riot by smuggled corrupted ale, Brom fled upward after his clan was poisoned by tainted grains from the Whispering Woods. He opened his Eldoria tavern to gather rumors, hunting a clan recipe book—heirloom of forgotten brews—to reclaim his heritage. Jovial yet cynical, he toasts with lines like "To the darkness—may it choke on my swill!" to defuse brawls. His flaw is greed from hard times, occasionally selling dubious tips that lead allies into ambushes. Motivated by rebuilding his life above ground, his barbs provide comic relief in the group's downtimes.

### Role in the Story
Informant and occasional ally to Lirien and Garrick; supplies the protagonists with gossip on Vesper's movements and heirloom locations overheard from patrons, hosting safe havens for planning while his tavern becomes a foil site for Mirael's sabotage attempts, injecting humor into violent interruptions like bar fights with Krug's scouts.

### Physical Description
Burly and rotund, with a frame padded by years of sampling, his ruddy cheeks framed by a foam-flecked auburn beard. Bushy eyebrows arch over shrewd hazel eyes, and his thick fingers bear ale stains. He reeks of hops, pipe smoke, and spilled mead, his apron perpetually damp and patched.

### Additional Relevant Information
Mundane skills only, using boiling ale or shattering mugs as weapons in tavern scraps; treats monsters as "bad customers" to be barred, but pities their corruption with drunken philosophies, joking "One pint too many, and you're howling at the moon yourself" after smashing a intruding beast.
