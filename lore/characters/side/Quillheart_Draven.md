# Draven Quillheart (Side Character)

### Race/Species
Human (from Eldoria's scholarly towers, of scribe families with faint elven archival ties).

### Class/Specialty/Job
Librarian/Archivist – deciphers ancient tomes and maps, providing lore on relics and curses.

### Background and Personality
Tutored in Eldoria's libraries in his 40th year, amid a book-burning purge of "cursed" texts by fearful mobs, Draven hid forbidden volumes, seeking an elven codex—heirloom of lost knowledge—to preserve history. Bookish and dryly ironic, he mutters "Knowledge is power—until a monster uses it as kindling." His flaw is physical frailty, crumbling under stress into wheezing fits. Motivated by truth, his insights guide ethically murky paths.

### Role in the Story
Informant foil to Lirien; decodes clues on the protagonists' heirlooms from hidden archives, clashing with Vesper's relic hunts by withholding info, leading to violent library raids where his wit shines in narrow escapes.

### Physical Description
Stooped and bespectacled, with ink-stained fingers and sallow skin from lamplight vigils. Thinning gray hair clings to a balding pate, and his myopic brown eyes squint behind thick lenses. He smells of dust, parchment, and weak tea, his robes threadbare and pocketed with quills.

### Additional Relevant Information
Mundane expertise only, no magic; views monsters as "footnotes in tragedy," researching their corruption for weaknesses but quipping "Page turner—literally, if it bites" during attacks, blending scholarly detachment with humorous peril.
