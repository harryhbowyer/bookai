# Elowen Driftwood (Side Character)

### Race/Species
Half-elf (elf mother from the Whispering Woods' outer glades, human father a wandering sailor from Eldoria's docks).

### Class/Specialty/Job
Beast Handler/Tracker – tames and communicates with wild animals for scouting and combat support, using whistles and scents rather than magic.

### Background and Personality
Raised on the fringes of the Whispering Woods in her 19th year, during a rare starfall that lit the night like false dawn, Elowen lost her parents to a corrupted wolf pack raid, surviving by bonding with a orphaned fox pup that became her lifelong companion. She now roams as a freelance tracker, seeking a family heirloom—a carved wooden whistle said to summon uncorrupted beasts—to rebuild her sense of pack. Resourceful and wryly optimistic, she cracks jokes like "Monsters eat your family? Fine, I'll just adopt the next one that tries" to mask her loneliness. Her flaw is over-attachment to animals, leading to risky diversions during fights to save strays, often resulting in bloody scrapes. Motivated by a need for companionship amid the darkness, her humor lightens tense hunts.

### Role in the Story
Supporting ally to Sylara and Lirien; aids the protagonists in navigating the Whispering Woods by deploying her animal network to scout monster movements, providing early warnings about Vesper's rituals while her bond with beasts offers insights into the corruption, occasionally clashing with Krug's raiders in skirmishes that highlight her non-violent preferences.

### Physical Description
Lithe and weathered from trail life, with tanned skin dotted by faint bite scars that itch under fur touches. Her wavy chestnut hair is tied back with leather thongs, revealing slightly pointed ears, and her amber eyes scan like a hawk's. She smells of musk and wild berries, her nimble hands always scratched and dirt-streaked from handling creatures.

### Additional Relevant Information
No magic, relying on innate empathy and training to calm beasts before corruption takes hold; views monsters as "badly trained pets" and attempts to redirect them non-lethally, but resorts to violent takedowns with snares if needed, quipping "Sorry, pup—time for a dirt nap" post-fight to cope with the gore.
