# Fizzle Quickfingers (Side Character)

### Race/Species
Gnome (from the tinkering warrens of Deepholm's gadget district, inventive lineage with a dash of surface trader blood).

### Class/Specialty/Job
Merchant/Peddler – hawks oddities and trinkets in Eldoria's markets, specializing in lockpicks, potions, and rumor-mongering for profit.

### Background and Personality
Sprung from Deepholm's steam-filled workshops in his 42nd year, during an invention expo sabotaged by corrupted vapors, Fizzle lost his shop to a explosion and now wanders surfaces, seeking a gnomish heirloom—a multi-tool ring—to fund his comeback. Chatty and opportunistically sly, he haggles with puns like "This dagger's sharp enough to cut your losses—or your throat, if you lowball me!" His flaw is compulsive lying to close deals, eroding trust and sparking chases. Motivated by wealth to escape poverty, his fast-talk adds humorous tension to transactions.

### Role in the Story
Comic relief and minor foil to Thorne; sells the protagonists dubious gear for their quests, inadvertently aiding against Mirael's traps by offloading faulty items that backfire on villains, while his market stall serves as a neutral info hub clashing with Vesper's spies, leading to chaotic, violent haggling scenes.

### Physical Description
Short and wiry, with a nimble build suited for dodging debts, his freckled skin smudged by ink and oil. Tufts of wild orange hair poke from under a battered cap, and his beady green eyes dart like profit signs. He smells of cheap incense and rust, his small hands flashing rings and pouches.

### Additional Relevant Information
No magic, just clever contraptions like spring-loaded boots for escapes; sees monsters as "big buyers with no coin," fleeing them with gadgets but quipping "Run like your life's on sale—which it is!" during pursuits, blending humor with narrow, bloody evasions.
