# Tirael Windscar (Side Character)

### Race/Species
Half-elf (human father from Ironspine nomads, elf mother exiled from Woods for wind magic affinity).

### Class/Specialty/Job
Rival Adventurer/Bounty Hunter – tracks marks with a crossbow, competing for bounties on corrupted beasts.

### Background and Personality
Windswept in the mountains in her 24th year, during a gale carrying corruption spores, Tirael lost her caravan to blighted storms, now hunting solos for a wind-charm heirloom to control tempests. Competitive and snarky, she taunts "Your quest's cute—mine pays in gold and glory." Her flaw is rivalry-fueled recklessness, stealing kills and sparking feuds. Motivated by independence, she challenges the group's dynamics.

### Role in the Story
Foil and reluctant ally to Garrick; competes for monster bounties in Woods fringes, occasionally teaming against Krug's hordes but betraying for profit, her arcs adding tension through violent rivalries resolved in bloody truces.

### Physical Description
Athletic and scarred by wind lashes, with bronzed skin and windswept auburn hair cropped short. Heterochromatic eyes—one green, one blue—scan horizons, and her lithe form bears feather tattoos. She smells of ozone and leather, her boots caked in trail dust.

### Additional Relevant Information
Minor wind magic for gusts aiding shots, but erratic; sees monsters as "storm fodder" to fell, boasting "Breeze through 'em like chaff" mid-hunt, her humor cutting through violence like a gale.
