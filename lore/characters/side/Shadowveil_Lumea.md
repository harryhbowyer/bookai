# Lumea Shadowveil (Side Character)

### Race/Species
Elf (from the veiled mists of the Whispering Woods' eastern boughs, ancient seer bloodline untouched by human mixing).

### Class/Specialty/Job
Healer/Herbalist – brews remedies and poultices from forest flora, mending wounds with salves and subtle incantations.

### Background and Personality
Awakened in the Woods' misty core in her 98th year, during a blight's first whisper, Lumea was shunned for healing a corrupted scout against elders' orders, now foraging alone for an elven herb satchel—heirloom of restorative essences—to atone. Gentle but biting, she soothes with sarcasm like "Hold still, hero—stitches hurt less than your ego." Her flaw is pacifism bordering on denial, hesitating in fights and prolonging suffering. Motivated by redemption, her care contrasts the world's brutality.

### Role in the Story
Supporting ally to Sylara; patches the protagonists after Woods skirmishes, revealing corruption clues through herb reactions while her mercy foils Vesper's necrotic assaults, leading to tense rescues where her non-violence sparks bloody group debates.

### Physical Description
Slender and poised, with luminous pale skin veined like leaf patterns. Flowing silver hair braided with dried blooms frames violet eyes soft as dawn. She carries the aroma of lavender and earth, her delicate hands stained green from grinding leaves.

### Additional Relevant Information
Minor herbal magic for accelerated healing, but it falters on deep corruptions; approaches monsters with curative attempts before violence, murmuring "Even shadows need light" before fleeing gore, her humor a quiet balm like "Wounds close, but grudges fester—choose wisely."
