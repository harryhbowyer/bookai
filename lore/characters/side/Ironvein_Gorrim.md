# Gorrim Ironvein (Side Character)

### Race/Species
Dwarf (from Deepholm's vein-mining clans, stout workers with no external blood).

### Class/Specialty/Job
Blacksmith/Armorer – forges weapons and repairs gear, specializing in anti-corruption alloys.

### Background and Personality
Hammered in Deepholm's forges in his 76th year, when corrupted veins collapsed his tunnel, Gorrim emerged scarred, seeking a dwarven anvil—heirloom of unbreakable steel—to rearm his kin. Gruff and philosophical, he grunts "Steel bends, fools break—pick your poison." His flaw is stubborn pride, refusing aid and causing delays. Motivated by craft legacy, he bolsters the fight.

### Role in the Story
Supporting ally to Thorne; outfits the protagonists with upgraded arms for heirloom quests, countering Mirael's sabotages by detecting tainted metal, his shop a haven amid violent forge defenses.

### Physical Description
Muscular and soot-blackened, with a barrel torso and braided black beard singed at tips. Deep-set black eyes glow like coals, and his hammer-callused hands dwarf tools. He reeks of charcoal, metal, and sweat, his apron scarred by sparks.

### Additional Relevant Information
No magic, pure smithing; treats monsters as "ore impurities" to hammer out, joking "Hot enough to melt your mama's heart—or your face" during heated battles, fusing humor with brutal craftsmanship.
