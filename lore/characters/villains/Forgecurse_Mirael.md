# Mirael Forgecurse (Villain Character)

### Race/Species
Dwarf (from the polluted undercrofts of Deepholm, of a disgraced artisan clan tainted by forbidden experiments with surface curses).

### Class/Specialty/Job
Saboteur/Alchemist – engineers insidious traps and corrosive elixirs, blending mechanical contraptions with chemical warfare for stealthy sabotage.

### Background and Personality
Crafted in the flickering torchlight of Deepholm's lower forges in her 120th year, amid a toxic spill from corrupted roots seeping underground, Mirael betrayed her clan by allying with the darkness to seize control, using it to poison rivals and claim a lost elven amulet for its revelatory powers twisted toward espionage. She now schemes to undermine surface dwellers, driven by resentment toward "tree-hugging elves and mountain oafs" who hoard relics. Sly and venomously clever, her humor drips with acidic sarcasm, like "Trust is like my potions—looks harmless until it melts your face." Her flaw is vengeful pettiness from clan rejection, leading to elaborate but fragile schemes that crumble under scrutiny. Motivated by a desire for dwarven supremacy through corruption, she injects the narrative with manipulative violence, her traps delivering ironic demises laced with mocking notes.

### Role in the Story
Tertiary antagonist and manipulative schemer; infiltrates the protagonists' paths via forged alliances and sabotaged heirlooms (targeting Lirien's amulet and Thorne's core), feeding intel to Vesper and Krug while sowing paranoia in the band, her subtle machinations contrasting the brute force and forcing ethical twists in the Whispering Woods' conflicts.

### Physical Description
Compact and wiry, with a deceptive delicacy masking sinewy strength from forge labor, her pallid skin pitted by chemical burns that shimmer iridescently. A cropped mop of iron-gray hair frames a sharp-featured face with one milky eye from an experiment gone awry, and her thin lips curl in perpetual smirks. She carries the acrid tang of acids and molten metal, her deft hands gloved in scarred leather, fingers stained with volatile residues.

### Additional Relevant Information
Her alchemical "magic" corrupts mundane inventions into weapons that mimic the darkness (e.g., blight-spreading grenades), but overuse causes addictive tremors; she toys with monsters by baiting them into traps for study, quipping to Thorne "Your gadgets are toys—mine are the punchline to your explosion." This ties into the genre's dark humor through booby-trapped heirlooms that deliver violent, comically timed betrayals, humanizing her threat with glimpses of regretful ingenuity.
