# Krug Bloodhowl (Villain Character)

### Race/Species
Human (from the war-torn borderlands near the Ironspine Mountains, of barbaric stock hardened by endless clan feuds and monster incursions).

### Class/Specialty/Job
Berserker/Warlord – commands raiding parties with dual warhammers, excelling in frenzied close-combat that shatters shields and bones alike.

### Background and Personality
Raised in the blood-soaked camps of the borderlands during the raging storms of his 35th year, Krug survived a monster raid that slaughtered his tribe by embracing the corruption's rage, emerging as its champion after devouring a tainted beast's heart. Now he hunts a dwarven heirloom—the perpetual flame core—to forge an army of berserkers, fueled by a savage code that equates strength with survival in a "world of weaklings." Brutish and bombastic, his dark humor roars through guttural laughs, boasting "I collect ears like souvenirs—yours'll make a fine rattle!" amid the carnage. His flaw is blind fury from untreated trauma, causing him to slaughter indiscriminately and alienate potential followers, turning victories pyrrhic. Driven by a primal urge to dominate the encroaching darkness rather than fight it, he embodies the book's violence with gleeful savagery, his jests lightening his own horrors like war chants.

### Role in the Story
Secondary antagonist and brute enforcer; leads corrupted monster raids on Eldoria and the Whispering Woods, clashing directly with Garrick and Thorne in brutal melees while pursuing their heirlooms to arm his horde, serving as Vesper's muscle and heightening the protagonists' survival stakes through relentless, gore-drenched assaults.

### Physical Description
Massive and hulking, with a frame rippling under layers of ritual scars and beast-hide tattoos that ooze faint ichor. His weathered face is a map of gashes, topped by a mane of matted black hair streaked with bone fragments, and his yellowed eyes bulge with unquenchable bloodlust. He stinks of congealed blood, rancid meat, and unwashed fury, his ham-sized fists perpetually clenched around hammer hafts slick with drying gore.

### Additional Relevant Information
No magic, only enhanced ferocity from corruption that lets him shrug off wounds like "mosquito bites," but it erodes his sanity, causing hallucinatory rages; he mocks the protagonists' moral qualms by parading captured monsters as "pets" before butchering them, trading barbs with Garrick like "Your axe swings like a lover's caress—mine kisses goodbye!" His role amplifies the violent humor, turning fights into chaotic brawls where his over-the-top roars punctuate dismemberments.
