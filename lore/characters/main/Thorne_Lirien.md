# Lirien Thorne (Main Character)

### Race/Species
Half-elf (human mother from the bustling trade city of Eldoria, elf father exiled from the Whispering Woods for consorting with outsiders).

### Class/Specialty/Job
Rogue/Thief – specializes in stealthy reconnaissance, lockpicking, and short blades for quick, lethal strikes.

### Background and Personality
Born in the shadowed outskirts of Eldoria during the blood moon of her 22nd year, Lirien was orphaned young when a monster raid—twisted beasts corrupted by an ancient forest curse—devastated her family's caravan. Raised by a thieves' guild in the city's underbelly, she honed her skills scavenging heirlooms from the dead, driven by a gnawing need to reclaim a lost elven amulet said to reveal hidden truths, which her father left behind as a promise of belonging. Fiercely independent with a sharp, cynical wit, she deflects trauma with morbid quips like "Death's just the ultimate lockpick—opens every door eventually." Her flaw is a deep-seated paranoia from years of betrayal, leading to impulsive distrust that often escalates minor threats into bloody brawls. Motivated by a desire for redemption and a place among her dual heritages, she's loyal to her found family but quick to cut ties if vulnerability shows.

### Role in the Story
Primary protagonist and group scout; leads the band of adventurers in infiltrating enemy strongholds and uncovering clues about the encroaching darkness corrupting the Whispering Woods, using her heritage to bridge human-elf tensions while her moral ambiguity forces the group to confront ethical dilemmas in their quest.

### Physical Description
Slender and wiry build honed for silent prowls, with pale skin scarred from old blade fights that faintly glow under moonlight like faint elven runes. Her pointed ears peek through tousled raven-black hair tied in a practical braid, and her hazel eyes—sharp as daggers—flicker with a predatory gleam. She smells of damp earth and oiled leather, her callused hands always fidgeting with a hidden knife.

### Additional Relevant Information
No innate magic, relying on mundane cunning and alchemical tricks (like scent-masking potions) to evade monsters; views corrupted beasts as tragic echoes of the forest's ancient guardians, often attempting parley with a whispered elven phrase before resorting to violent dissection for clues. Her dark humor shines in gore-soaked aftermaths, joking about "collecting monster teeth for my retirement necklace" to cope with the brutality.
