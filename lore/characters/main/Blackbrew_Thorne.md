# Thorne Blackbrew (Main Character)

### Race/Species
Dwarf (from the underground forges of Deepholm, stout lineage of miners and smiths with no elven or human admixture).

### Class/Specialty/Job
Artificer/Engineer – crafts explosive gadgets, steam-powered armor, and alchemical bombs for ranged and close-quarters demolition.

### Background and Personality
Forged in the sweltering depths of Deepholm in his 87th year, amid a cave-in triggered by surface monsters burrowing through corrupted roots, Thorne lost his forge-family and now hunts a dwarven heirloom—a perpetual flame core—to rebuild and ignite vengeance. A tinkerer at heart, he's gruffly optimistic with a penchant for black comedy, muttering "Boom goes the family reunion" after rigging traps. His flaw is obsessive perfectionism, leading to reckless experiments that endanger the group, born from guilt over failing to warn his kin. Driven by innovation to counter the darkness, he's the comic relief, his inventions sparking both literal and figurative humor in violent escapades.

### Role in the Story
Co-protagonist and inventor; equips the band with tools to breach monster lairs and ancient ruins in the Whispering Woods, his gadgets pivotal in key battles while his quest for the core uncovers technological lore about the corruption's spread.

### Physical Description
Stocky and barrel-chested, with a sturdy build reinforced by forge scars and grease stains, his ruddy complexion flushed from heat. A wild red beard braided with metal rings frames a square jaw, and his keen brown eyes sparkle behind soot-smeared spectacles. He smells of oil, sulfur, and ale, his thick fingers blackened from tinkering, always clutching a multi-tool wrench.

### Additional Relevant Information
No personal magic, but his inventions mimic it through dwarven ingenuity (e.g., flame-throwers fueled by alchemical mixes); sees monsters as geological pests to be mined out, yet ponders their corruption philosophically, joking "Even rocks crack under pressure—imagine the poor beasts." His violent contributions involve explosive finales, blending humor with gore as devices backfire comically before succeeding brutally.
