# Garrick Ironfist (Main Character)

### Race/Species
Human (from the rugged hill clans of the Ironspine Mountains, pureblooded with no mixed heritage).

### Class/Specialty/Job
Barbarian/Warrior – excels in raw melee combat with a massive greataxe, channeling berserker rage for devastating, crowd-clearing assaults.

### Background and Personality
Hailing from a remote mountain village in his 28th year, during a harsh winter siege by goblin raiders twisted by the same woodland curse, Garrick lost his clan to the onslaught, surviving only by burying himself under the bodies of his kin. He wandered as a sellsword, seeking a legendary clan heirloom—a rune-etched hammer—to honor the dead and forge a new legacy. Boisterous yet brooding, he's got a gravelly laugh that booms like thunder, masking grief with violent outbursts and ironic jests such as "I've got more scars than sense—keeps the cold out, at least." His flaw is an explosive temper rooted in survivor's guilt, turning allies into targets during heated arguments. Driven by a thirst for vengeance against the corrupting darkness, he's the group's unbreakable anchor, his crude humor lightening the mood after savage fights.

### Role in the Story
Co-protagonist and frontline tank; protects the group during brutal monster clashes in the Whispering Woods, his unyielding fury driving charges against the encroaching threats while his personal quest for the heirloom intertwines with the band's mission to stem the corruption.

### Physical Description
Towering and broad-shouldered, built like a forge anvil with sun-weathered skin crisscrossed by jagged scars from axe blows and beast claws. His shaggy brown hair and thick beard are flecked with gray, framing stormy blue eyes that burn with restrained rage. He reeks of sweat, smoke, and iron polish, his massive hands—knuckles like hammered steel—gripping his weapon with white-knuckled fervor.

### Additional Relevant Information
Purely mundane fighter with no magic, augmented by clan tattoos that enhance endurance through sheer willpower; treats monsters as vermin to be crushed, but a rare moment of reflection reveals pity for their corrupted forms, leading to grim one-liners like "Poor bastards—rage is a hell of a drug" mid-swing. His violence is cathartic, often ending battles with a bloody roar that echoes the genre's brutal intensity.
