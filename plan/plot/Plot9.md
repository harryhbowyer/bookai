# Plot 9: Assault on Vesper's Lair

Infiltrating Vesper's shadowed enclave in the Woods' heart, supported by Stoutbarrel Brom's dwarven ale-fueled morale boost and Windscar Tirael's aerial scouting, the protagonists battle necrotic swarms; Lirien's stealth disables wards, while Thorne and Garrick provide explosive diversions, culminating in Sylara's purifying ritual clashing with Vesper's shadows.
